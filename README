Requirements
============

The PyPy Sandbox must be compiled from source, with the following options

python ../../rpython/bin/rpython -O2 --sandbox targetpypystandalone --withmod-_pypyjson --withmod-struct --withmod-codecs --withmod-binascii

Once you have that done, change the PYPY_PATH variable in the file run_sandbox.py
